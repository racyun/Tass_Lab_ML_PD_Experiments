## returns "wSignalArray" which specifies how strong the influence of 
## the stimuli delivered to the M stimulation sites is on individual neurons
#  
#  stimulus profiles for individual stimuli have the shape:
#
#  wSignal_ij = wkl/(1 + (Xi - Xsitej)^2/sigmaj^2)              (1)
#
#  Here, i is the index of the neuron and j is the index of the stimulation site.
#  sigmaj is the width the profile in mm. To get an equivalent rectangular width of "A" choose sigmaj="A/pi" . 
#
#  ouput:
#  "wSignalArray" has dimensions (N, nElectrodes) where N is total number of STN and GPe neurons and
#                 nElectrodes it the number of stimulation sites
#
#  input:
#  "sites"        numpy array of lengths "nElectrodes" containing the center coordinates of all stimulation sites
#  "positions"    Dictionary in which each key refers to a numpy array of the X coordinates of neurons
#                 of a certain type. The total number of neurons "N" is obtained by summing the lengths of position arrays
#                 for all keys in this array.
#  "stim_par"     dictionary contains all stimulus parameters
#                 specifically
#                 stim_par[ "sigmaj" ] ... Numpy array of lengths "number of neuron types" (the number of keys in "positions").
#                                          Entry j is the width of stimuli delivered the jth stimulation site in mm.
#                 stim_par["receive_stim"] . array of floats of shape ( nElectrodes , number of neuron types). If entry [k,l] is wkl then the 
#                                            stimuli delivered to the kth stimulation site affect neuron type l with a relative strengths of wkl (see Equation 1). 
#
