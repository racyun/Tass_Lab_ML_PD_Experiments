This project is a collaboration with Stanford's Tass Lab to explore AI-driven approaches for enhancing neuromodulation techniques, with a focus on optimizing the functionality of a vibrotactile glove. The glove delivers hand-based pulses aimed at desynchronizing brain activity, offering potential for personalized treatment of Parkinson’s disease and epilepsy.

My role in this project involves developing and evaluating machine learning models to optimize key stimulation parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude, duration, etc.) in order to improve patient outcomes while minimizing side effects.

Repository Overview: 

crs_plastic_neurons_experiments
 - This folder contains experiments using neural networks to analyze synchronized and multistable activity across different types of plastic neuron networks: homogeneous, intermediate, and inhomogeneous.


parkinsons_voice_measurements_classification
 - This folder explores the use of large language models (GPT) to classify and extract insights from Parkinson’s disease-related voice measurement data.
 - By prompting these models, I gained a deeper understanding of the dataset’s structure and identified key patterns and feature importance.
